## Ethical Concerns

1. **Representation**: Many of the studies were performed in Western countries and had a strong bias to diagnose boys under the age of 18.
2. **Stigma and potential harm**: While autism is more well understood today, this was not always the case. Some of the events discussed are strong reminders of the history of intense ableism.

## Future Work
